# bamazon

The bamazon app has two different functions; the first is used by customers to purchase items, and the second is a manager interface, used to check and add inventory, view current items, and adding new products to the database.

The app itself uses node.js, with the npm inquirer and npm mysql packages (ensure these are installed before you run the program), to communicate with the database. Here is a video showing the app in action. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lrPRgSmnPU9cy79DR-ftO9ygDg3TUISf/view.
